# Speaker Gender Classification

## TODO

- create two folders for classification under nb

## Project description

<p style="text-align: center;">
This a deep-learning project. It contains a ResNet-34 trained on 24000 WAVs labelled by gender and validated on 6000 WAVs. The entire audio corpus consists of 30000 WAVs. It is generated by 60 unique speakers, each producing 50 instances of each digit (0-9). 
</p>

## Record and classify your own voice

Please read section "Setup" and "Folder structure" first.

You can run `scripts/record_wav.py` in command line to record yourself saying a digit (0-9). The recording lasts for one second so you need to say a digit as soon as you see "Speak now!" in the terminal. You can then move the WAV file into `nb/my_wavs`. Finally, you can run `nbs/04_deploy_model.py` to get classification(s).

## Setup

- Create a new directory.
- Clone this project (as an independent folder) inside that directory.
- Clone [AudioMNIST](https://github.com/soerenab/AudioMNIST) (as an independent folder) inside that directory.
- Install Python packages: tqdm, numpy, scipy, librosa, scikit-image, pytorch, fastai.
- This project is written in jupyter notebooks.

## Dataset

[AudioMNIST](https://github.com/soerenab/AudioMNIST)

- Data is available under `AudioMNIST/data`.
- Recorded in Germany.
- 60 speakers (one directory per speaker).
- 50 instances of each digit per speaker.
- 30000 audio samples of spoken digits (0-9).
- I chose gender because there are at least 10 instances of each gender (see below).
- Caution: Since there are only 60 speakers, the training and validation sets overlap in terms of speakers (but not specific instances of speech). Future work should make sure that the training and validation sets do not overlap even in terms of speakers.
- Exploratory data analysis (see `nb/eda.ipynb`):

## Feature engineering

Here's the primary preprocessing function I used. For more information, see `nb/eda.ipynb`.

```python
def pipeline(signal):
    
    emphasized_signal = pre_emphasis(signal)
  
    lifted_mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(
        y=emphasized_signal.astype(float), 
        sr=sample_rate, 
        n_mfcc=12, 
        dct_type=2, 
        norm='ortho', 
        lifter=22,
        n_fft = int(sample_rate * 0.025),
        hop_length= int(sample_rate * 0.01),
        power=2,
        center=False,
        window='hanning',
        n_mels=40
    )

    return lifted_mfcc

```

## Train model

- Used the fastai library.
- Used transfer learning:
    - Trained the classifier of a ResNet-34 pretrained on ImageNet for 2 epochs.
    - Trained the entire model for 1 epoch.

## Evaluate model

- Error rate: 1.07%
- Confusion matrix: <img src='./pngs/confusion_matrix.png' width=200>
- F1 score: 0.973
